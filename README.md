## Summary
Assume a bank which provides services (i.e., deposit, withdraw, and transfer) to exactly three clients. Each
client can be characterized by their name and numerical balance. We may want to perform one of the
following kinds of transactions:
- Deposit some amount of money **to** a client’s account.
- Withdraw some amount of money **from** a client’s account.
- Transfer some amount of money **from** a client’s account **to** another client’s account.
Upon the completion of each transaction, the user should be informed (via an output on the mobile screen)
of all three clients’ latest balances.
